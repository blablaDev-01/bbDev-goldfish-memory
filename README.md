# goldfish memory

at some point in your life you played this game, and if you're like us, you probably sucked at it. but now we have Google and keep and terabytes of space and all of the :cloud:, soooo we good.

you already know the rules for this one, but just to make sure you don't forget _(pun intended)_

### coding stack:
- `JavaScript`
- `HTML`
- `CSS`

### requirements:
-  game needs to be responsive, feel free to use a [grid][d1b51a7d] (and [this][7f585200])
- the user needs to select two/three same cards and gets a point for every pair (5 points if you're playing 3 of the kind), remaining time in seconds gets added to the score
- in every new game, cards are shuffled and scattered around
- the game lasts for 2 minutes
- **START** button resets the game if one is already in progress
- cards are not clickable if the game/clock hasn't started
- matched card stay flipped and have the opacity of `0.3` and are disabled for clicks
- **top 5 scores** open in a modal window and are stored in `sessionStorage` so after a refresh they are still there, you can learn more about it [here][e4f07d8e]
- and [this][105e4d1a] is how you're gonna flip the card
- all other sane rules apply

## blablaDev concept

#### a picture is worth a thousand words

you pick a project and work on it as you normally would. when you're done, you make a PR and we'll examine your code and give you a review. **we'll review your project 3 times**, so make sure those PRs count. after that, you can (and should) still work on your project and improve it, after all this is your CV :grinning:

after every PR you get a certain score _(you can check those in our app)_ and you go on our ranking list. companies lurk among this list and look for promising developers to hire, make sure you impress them!
